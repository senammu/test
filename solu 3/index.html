In East India, it is misidentified with Phuchhka which is very different from Panipuri.The Puchhka (also called so in Bangladesh) differs greatly in terms of content and taste.  In North India, it is called Golgappa, In madhaya pradesh It is called Fulki, In Andhra Pradesh and Telangana its is called as Pani Puri While in Odisha it is known as GupChup . It consists of a round, hollow puri, fried crisp and filled with a mixture of flavored water (commonly known as Imli Pani), tamarind chutney, chili, chaat masala, potato, onion and chickpeas.Panipuri literally means "water bread". Little is known about its origins. The term pani puri was recorded in 1955; and golgappa in 1951.There was a monthly children's magazine published in 1970 in Delhi, called Golgappa. Panipuri was used in the movie Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi starring Sharukh Khan and Anushka Sharma, in which they had the "Golgappa eating challenge". </p>
